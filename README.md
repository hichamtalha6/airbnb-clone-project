  An in-memory data structure store used for caching and session management to speed up response times.

- **GitHub Actions**  
  Provides CI/CD pipelines to automate testing, building, and deployment of the application.


## Database Design

### Key Entities

- **Users**
  - Fields: `id`, `name`, `email`, `password_hash`, `role` (guest or host), `created_at`
  - Description: Represents both guests and hosts. Hosts can list properties, while guests can book properties and leave reviews.

- **Properties**
  - Fields: `id`, `host_id`, `title`, `description`, `location`, `price_per_night`, `created_at`
  - Description: A property listed by a host. Each property belongs to a user (the host).

- **Bookings**
  - Fields: `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `status`
  - Description: A reservation made by a guest for a property. Each booking belongs to one guest (user) and one property.

- **Reviews**
  - Fields: `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `rating`, `comment`, `created_at`
  - Description: Guests can leave reviews for properties they have booked. Each review belongs to a user and a property.

- **Payments**
  - Fields: `id`, `booking_id`, `amount`, `payment_method`, `payment_date`, `status`
  - Description: Represents a transaction linked to a booking. Each payment is tied to one booking.

## Feature Breakdown

- **User Management**  
  Allows users to register, log in, and manage their profiles. Supports both roles: hosts (who list properties) and guests (who book properties), with secure authentication and authorization.

- **Property Management**  
  Hosts can create, update, and manage property listings with details such as title, description, location, price, and availability. This enables a wide variety of accommodations to be displayed on the platform.

- **Booking System**  
  Guests can search for available properties, make reservations for specific dates, and track their bookings. The system ensures that bookings are validated to avoid double reservations.

- **Payment Integration**  
  Provides a secure way for guests to pay for their bookings. Handles different payment statuses (e.g., pending, completed, failed) and ensures financial transactions are safely processed.

- **Review & Rating System**  
  Guests can leave reviews and ratings for properties they have stayed at. This helps build trust and transparency on the platform by allowing future guests to make informed decisions.

- **Search & Filtering**  
  Users can search for properties based on location, price range, date availability, and other filters. This improves the user experience by making it easier to find suitable accommodations.

- **Admin Dashboard (Optional Extension)**  
  Administrators can oversee users, properties, and bookings. This ensures proper monitoring, moderation, and management of the platform.
  
## API Security

Ensuring security is a critical part of this project. The following measures will be implemented to protect users, properties, and financial transactions:

- **Authentication**  
  Only registered users can access protected endpoints using secure methods (e.g., JWT or OAuth2). This prevents unauthorized access and ensures that only verified users can interact with the platform.

- **Authorization**  
  Role-based access control (RBAC) ensures that users can only perform actions that match their role. For example, hosts can list properties, while guests can only book properties. This prevents abuse and unauthorized operations.

- **Data Encryption**  
  Sensitive information such as passwords and payment details will be encrypted both in transit (via HTTPS/TLS) and at rest. This is essential to protect user credentials and financial data from potential breaches.

- **Rate Limiting & Throttling**  
  API requests will be rate-limited to prevent abuse, such as brute-force login attempts or denial-of-service attacks. This helps maintain availability and performance of the platform.

- **Input Validation & Sanitization**  
  All incoming data will be validated and sanitized to prevent SQL injection, XSS, and other malicious attacks. This ensures that only clean and safe data enters the system.

- **Secure Payments**  
  Payment transactions will be processed through a trusted third-party provider (e.g., Stripe/PayPal). This ensures compliance with security standards and protects sensitive payment information.

### Why Security is Crucial

- **Protecting User Data**: Personal information (names, emails, passwords) must remain private and secure.  
- **Securing Payments**: Users must trust the platform to handle financial transactions safely.  
- **Preventing Unauthorized Access**: Ensures that malicious actors cannot manipulate or steal data.  
- **Maintaining Platform Reliability**: Strong security prevents downtime from attacks, ensuring a reliable service for all users.

## CI/CD Pipeline

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines automate the process of building, testing, and deploying the application.  
They ensure that every change pushed to the repository is verified, tested, and deployed consistently, reducing errors and speeding up development.

### Why CI/CD is Important
- **Consistency**: Automates testing and deployment, reducing human error.  
- **Faster Development**: Allows developers to ship features and bug fixes quickly.  
- **Reliability**: Ensures that every build passes tests before going live.  
- **Scalability**: Supports continuous updates as the project grows.  

### Tools Used
- **GitHub Actions**: Automates testing, builds, and deployment workflows directly from the GitHub repository.  
- **Docker**: Containerizes the application, ensuring consistent environments across development, staging, and production.  
- **Nginx**: Used as a reverse proxy for handling traffic and load balancing in production deployments.  
- **Cloud Provider (AWS/Heroku/DigitalOcean)**: Hosts the deployed application for end users.
