## Feature Breakdown

- **User Management**  
  Allows users to register, log in, and manage their profiles. Supports both roles: hosts (who list properties) and guests (who book properties), with secure authentication and authorization.

- **Property Management**  
  Hosts can create, update, and manage property listings with details such as title, description, location, price, and availability. This enables a wide variety of accommodations to be displayed on the platform.

- **Booking System**  
  Guests can search for available properties, make reservations for specific dates, and track their bookings. The system ensures that bookings are validated to avoid double reservations.

- **Payment Integration**  
  Provides a secure way for guests to pay for their bookings. Handles different payment statuses (e.g., pending, completed, failed) and ensures financial transactions are safely processed.

- **Review & Rating System**  
  Guests can leave reviews and ratings for properties they have stayed at. This helps build trust and transparency on the platform by allowing future guests to make informed decisions.

- **Search & Filtering**  
  Users can search for properties based on location, price range, date availability, and other filters. This improves the user experience by making it easier to find suitable accommodations.

- **Admin Dashboard (Optional Extension)**  
  Administrators can oversee users, properties, and bookings. This ensures proper monitoring, moderation, and management of the platform.
